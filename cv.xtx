\runsubsection{Modeling spatio-temporal dynamics in primary visual cortex using deep neural network model}
\descript{| MSc. thesis (Ongoing)}
\emptyLocation % Hack to make following text correct size
\begin{tightitemize}
\item Conducted within the \textbf{Computational Systems Neuroscience Group (CSNG)} at Charles University.
\item Developed biologically inspired deep neural network (DNN) models to study neural responses in the primary visual cortex (V1).
\item Designed a multi-stage recurrent neural network (RNN) constrained by known anatomical structures to reflect the recurrent nature of biological networks.
\item Trained the model on neural recordings from macaque V1 and synthetic data generated by a spiking V1 model.
\item Introduced a novel approach by replacing RNN neurons with shared small DNNs to model complex non-linear spiking neuron behavior.
\item Focused on capturing fine temporal dynamics of V1 responses to natural images.
\item Code Github:// \href{https://github.com/dbeinhauer/mcs-source}{\bf dbeinhauer/mcs-source} \\
